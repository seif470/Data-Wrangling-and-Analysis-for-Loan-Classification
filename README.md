Data Wrangling and Analysis for Loan Classification 

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to loan applications to classify whether a loan should be approved or not. The main steps involved in this project are data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data transformation, and correlation analysis. These steps aim to prepare the data for machine learning models that can predict loan approval status based on various features.


# Steps

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers in the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculate summary statistics.

Visualize distributions of variables.

Create plots to understand relationships between different variables.

Identify patterns and trends influencing loan approval.

### Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary to capture valuable information from existing columns.

Example: Calculate total income by summing up applicant and co-applicant incomes.

### Data Transformation:

Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Standardize or normalize numerical features if required for certain machine learning algorithms.

### Correlation Analysis:

Analyze the correlation between various features and the target variable (Loan_Status).

Identify features with significant impact on loan approval.
